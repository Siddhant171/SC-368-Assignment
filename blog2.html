        <h1>Indian Education system</h1>
        <p>The role and importance of education system could be best understood by the above lines, because knowledge is something which lasts with you forever.</p>
        <p>Education is the catalytic tool that has the strength to transform the present and future of the youth and children of a nation. 
            A pre-equipped education is the prerequisite for the smooth, operative and constant growth of a country.
             A well-established education system serves as a building block for a nation on which the entire socio-economic structure is built up. 
             The goal of a sturdy and effective education system is something which every country cherishes in the present time.
              India is also running behind this to attain success in the education sector, but with an outdated study pattern. 
              As the current world operates on the principle of adapt or vanish, similar concept is applied in the field of education too.</p>
        <p>As it was rightly said by Einstein that“Everybody is a genius but if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid”.This is what currently prevails in the education system of the country too.</p>
