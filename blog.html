        <h1>The beautiful Nature</h1>
        <p>The absence of a deep emotional connection between humans and the natural world is at the root of the environmental crisis.

            <p>Can you think of a place in nature that you know really well?</p>
            
            <p>Close your eyes for a moment and see what comes up.</p>
            
            <p>Can you visualise the place in exquisite detail? The sounds, the colours, the smells, the subtleties that only you know.</p>
            
            <p>Do memories surface? Perhaps you have known this place for a long time. Maybe you spent golden moments from your childhood here? There might be happy memories tinged with sadness or regret?</p>
            
            <p>How does it feel when you bring this place to mind now?</p>
            
            <p>Please dont rush. Take a moment to connect.</p>
            
            <p>Now another question.</p>
            
            <p>How would you feel if this same place was under imminent threat? Imagine someone is destroying it right now. What do you feel? Anger? Sadness? Shock? Resignation? Nothing at all?</p>
            
            <p>Can you imagine that you might actually do something immediate and tangible to help protect this place?</p>
            
            <p>Be honest with yourself.</p>
